## Community

The Harness Community lives in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/harnesscommunity/shared_invite/zt-y4hdqh7p-RVuEQyIl5Hcx4Ck8VCvzBw)! Please take a moment to introduce yourself in our `#intro-yourself` channel and tell us about who you are, what you are building, and what interests you! Then use the channel browswer to look at our other channels like #events or product specific channels like `#drone` or `#cd-community`

We also host [events](https://www.meetup.com/harness/) within the Harness User Group which encompass everything from office hours to technical deep dives!

## üîé Where to Seek Help üîç

We have two main channels for seeking help and assistance.

We encourage you to use our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/harnesscommunity/shared_invite/zt-y4hdqh7p-RVuEQyIl5Hcx4Ck8VCvzBw) to ask for help with any issue.

## Where to Report Bugs üêõ 

Please report bugs in our [forum](https://community.harness.io/) under the bugs topic. 

## Contributing

We expect contributors to abide by our underlying [code of conduct](https://github.com/harness/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All conversations and discussions on GitHub (issues, pull requests) and across Harness socials must be respectful and harassment-free.

If you feel another member of the community has violated our Code of Conduct, you may anonymously contact the team with our code of [conduct report form(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezbICGabREywwpLauIJz68OrBxAjimiFt3SrxK9qnaxF8SzQ/viewform).

Remember that communication is the crucial to any project. We are all working on this together, and we are all benefiting from this software. It's very easy to misunderstand one another over asynchronous, text-based conversations: When in doubt, assume everyone within this project has the best intentions.

:sparkles: A full contributors guide is in the works and will be posted as available. :sparkles:
