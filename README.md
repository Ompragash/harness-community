## Community

The Harness Community lives in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/harnesscommunity/shared_invite/zt-y4hdqh7p-RVuEQyIl5Hcx4Ck8VCvzBw)! Please take a moment to introduce yourself in our `#intro-yourself` channel and tell us about who you are, what you are building, and what interests you! Then use the channel browswer to look at our other channels like #events or product specific channels like `#drone` or `#cd-community`

We also host [events](https://www.meetup.com/harness/) within the Harness User Group which encompass everything from office hours to technical deep dives!

## Where to Seek Help

We have two main channels for seeking help and assistance.

We encourage you to use our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/harnesscommunity/shared_invite/zt-y4hdqh7p-RVuEQyIl5Hcx4Ck8VCvzBw) to ask for help with any issue.
